-Neo Bowser City? cyberpunk, moody neon future
-ruined ancient like structures, throne room
-moody rainy scene, with marble floor, dirt ground
-flower field, tulips, roses, dandelions
-forest but purple... and lava... but light orange
-Maple syrup, honey, avocado, celery, tomato, sugar
-cogs, machinery, tech, technology
-Big warehouse, empty space with fans and wind turbines,
    kind of like that liminal space you often see in movies (?)
    and you can also see the shadows of the turbines
-big city metropolis somehow is in small separate blocks
    on floating islands\ground separated by space
    no fragmentation or anything,
    just you have a group of buildings here,
    and you have to walk a bit to reach this
    or that next group of building.
